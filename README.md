<h2>Airports Around You!</h2>

An up to date airport database with basic information about every airport and city code in the world.  
<p>
Each entry contains Timezone, name, city code, two-letter ISO country code, URL, elevation above sea level in feet, coordinates in decimal degrees, geo encoded city, county and state.
</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

The main idea of this repository is to get the JSON data about the airport by using its city code, TimeZone, name or ISO country code. 
If airport is not found, the 404 status code is returned.
